## Hi there 👋 My name is Nastasja!

I recently completed my master's degree in Computer Science at the Humboldt University of Berlin. 
So far, I have focused mainly on backend engineering and Data Science. I am passionate about both sides!

My master's thesis was the basis for my first-ever research paper, due to be published mid-January at the AI4BPM workshop.

**Also:** I am passionate about great design in every form:
whether it’s a beautifully structured codebase with great patterns, a thoughtfully designed web app, or even interior design.
For me, great design means clarity and impact. This is what I live for and what I strive for.  

### 💡 What I Care About (In Software Engineering)
- clean, maintainable code
- learning how things are built from the ground up
- solving real problems

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
My current tech stack includes Python and Java. I use MongoDB, scikit-learn, pandas and (of course) numpy.
I also enjoy using Spring Boot for great backend applications :) 

### 🌱 I'm Currently Learning
- Python frameworks such as Django and Flask
- great system design and architectural best practices
